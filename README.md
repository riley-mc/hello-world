# _My First Website_

#### _My first attempt at creating a README, October 12, 2020_

#### By _**Riley Mcadoo**_

## Description

_This is where I write my detailed description about my application. For now I will just ramble for the sake of taking up some space._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Look in the mirror and say to yourself, "You're awesome!"_
* _Open up your preferred browser_
* _Type in URL_
* _Enjoy the website_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_Probably a few_

## Support and contact details

_Contact me through Discord (Riley McAdoo)_

## Technologies Used

* _Git Bash_
* _Visusal Studio Code_
